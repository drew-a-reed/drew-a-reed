As a Junior Full Stack Web Developer at Spherexx.com, I create and maintain web applications that provide innovative and effective solutions for the real estate industry. I have been working in this role for over a year and a half, after graduating from a four-month Java Development Bootcamp at Tech Elevator, where I acquired the fundamentals of Java, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and ASP.NET.

I enjoy the challenge and creativity of programming, as well as the opportunity to make a positive impact through my work. I am passionate about learning new technologies and best practices, and I leverage my previous experience as a paramedic, where I gained valuable skills in emergency services, problem-solving, and teamwork. My goal is to continue growing and developing as a web developer, and to apply my knowledge and skills to deliver high-quality web solutions for our clients.

After 12 years as a paramedic, I am now ready to change, no more sirens!
