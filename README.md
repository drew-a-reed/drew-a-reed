ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Drew Reed.
ðŸ‘€ I have completed my Associate's Degree in Computer Science from Roger's State University
ðŸŒ± I have accepted my first position as a Junior Full-Stack Dev. I am starting out by doing a Full-Stack Bootcamp through Tech Elevator. My next 
update will be after I finish the bootcamp in June 2022.
ðŸ“« How to reach me... drew.reed@hotmail.com

After 12 years as a paramedic, I am now ready to change, no more sirens!
